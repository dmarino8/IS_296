Remember to reload the maven project
Go to the pom.xml file and select maven --> reload project

This will reload the maven dependecies.
.\mvnw.cmd -U marino.apudr idea:idea

This fixed the issue.
<version>${project.parent.version}</version>

Questions
The sdk version should match the spring version?

How to run a spring boot project through command-line.
./mvnw spring-b

Typically data will be loaded from a database

Starting with static is safer
Could also use a fake database to practice

This is how we are printing into Spring App
public ResponseEntity<Object> getDrones() {
        return new ResponseEntity<(droneRepo.values(), HttpStatus.OK);
}

Spring defaults to GET request if not defined

Use @PathVariable to use defined part of url as a value of a variable
Use @RequestBody to get something from the body? maybe?

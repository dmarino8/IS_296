Interfaces
Parent and child classes
Extends
Objects

When parent class is an interface use the implements keyword to inherit
When parent class is a regular class, use the extends keyword to inherit
In heritance saves time because you reuse working code

------------------------
Define the methods that will be implemented by any classes that inheriet-
-from the interface
Define a list of signatures
<Return Type> <Method Name>(0+ parameters)

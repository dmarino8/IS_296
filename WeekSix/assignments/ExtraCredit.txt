Hamcrest
-Hamcrest is a framework for writing test. It allows for greater control on the different aspects of your test. Hamcrest lets you make "just right" tests that are not brittle to change and are still effective.
-Hamcrest has a range of different matcher functions. Core, Logical, Object, Beans, Collections, Number, and Text matcher functions.
-Hamcrest also allows for you to create custom matchers. This option helps eliminate code duplications and makes tests more readable.

Assertions in TestNg
-You can use TestNg to test things directly in the browser. For example you can test the title of a webpage.
-TestNg uses Assert to do testing, there are numerous different types of asserts. Conditional, type and equal.

-When using selenium along side TestNg, you can now take screenshots of the browser when an error occurs. Thought that was pretty cool.
